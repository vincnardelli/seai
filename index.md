Welcome to the Spatial Analysis with R and Python course!
The material you will find on this site was created for the labs of the Spatial Econometrics Advanced Institute 2022 course organized by the Spatial Econometrics Association.


# Before starting
I invite you to setup R and Python on your computer to be able to follow all the lessons without problems. 
In the pages [R Setup](/seai/r_setup) and [Python Setup](/seai/python_setup) you will find all the necessary information. 
If you are not an expert user of Python, **I recommend you to use Colab**.
It is a totally cloud-based tool that avoids having to configure your computer (a google account is required).

In the section below you will find buttons for each lesson to automatically import all the material directly to Colab. Alternatively you can save all the material by downloading the ZIP file or cloning the Github repository.
