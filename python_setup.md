# Python Setup

## Google Colab  




Google makes available its free tool **Colab**.  Colab notebooks enable you to combine executable code and rich text in a single document, as well as images, HTML, LaTeX, and other formats. [Click here](https://colab.research.google.com) to be immediately redirected to Colab. Colab allows to escape installation issues that might happen in the Jupyter case and admin permissions limitations (e.g. a company laptop). As a result Colab is the deafult choice for this course.

### Quick Overview
Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

- Zero configuration required
- Free access to GPUs
- Easy sharing

>Whether you're a student, a data scientist or an AI researcher, Colab can make your work easier. - Google Colab

 Take a look at this [YT Colab quickstart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to get famniliar with Colab.

## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application for document authoring that combines live codes with narrative text, equations and views.

In order to install Jupyter Notebook  on your computer **you are required to follow step-by-step the documentation linked [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html)**.

### What you will end up with?

The fastest and easiest way to start with Python is with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. Moreover it allows scientist and analys to concentrate on data instead of environments and package management.

### For experienced Python users

> Jupyter installation requires Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7. IPython 1.x, which included the parts that later became Jupyter, was the last version to support > Python 3.2 and 2.6.

If you are *already* a Python user, you may prefer to install Jupyter via Python's package manager, pip, rather than Anaconda.

First, make sure you have the most recent pip; older versions may have problems with some dependencies:

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

Then, install the Jupyter Notebook by following this step:

```
pip3 install jupyter
```

Thank you very much. You have Jupyter Notebook installed.  
At this point you can become familiar with Jupyter Notebooks through [this resource](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running)
