# R Setup

We will use latest version of R (4.2) that you can download for free in [CRAN R website](https://cran.r-project.org/).
In addition we will use Rstudio IDE. It simplify most of the tasks but it is not required. You can download it on [Rstudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

To setup R and Rstudio on your computer you can follow the guide [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) which contains extensive documentation for Windows, Mac and Linux OS.
